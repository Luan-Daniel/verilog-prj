DE0 Top Quartus Project with Debounce IP (DE0_TOP_New)

The new DE0_TOP Quartus project includes a debounce IP for the DE0 push-buttons. 
DE0 users that intend to use the push-buttons in their design should launch their project using 
the new DE0_TOP project or by incorporating the debounce IP in their existing Quartus project. 
Note users adding the debounce IP in their existing project do not have to change the name of the 
push-buttons as it remains the same as the original DE0 top project. Thus, users can simply add the 
debounce IP without renaming the existing push-button names of their design.
